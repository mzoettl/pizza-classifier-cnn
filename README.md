# pizza-classifier-nnn
Binary classifier for pizza images by means of a convolutional neural net.

I made this fun little project as part of a uni course and decided to make it about something quite important - Pizza. I mean who else did not face the truly existential question of whether a given image depicts a slice of pizza or not? But don't you worry, I got you.
